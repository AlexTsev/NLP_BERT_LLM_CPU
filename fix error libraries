âœ… Correct environment setup

Uninstall any standalone Keras:

pip uninstall keras -y
pip uninstall tensorflow -y
pip uninstall transformers -y
pip uninstall huggingface-hub -y


Install compatible versions:

pip install tensorflow==2.14.0
pip install transformers==4.33.2
pip install huggingface-hub==0.17.3


Transformers >=4.33.0 fully supports tf.keras from TensorFlow and does not import standalone keras.

Check your imports in code:

Remove from keras imports.

Use only tf.keras in your code (which you already are doing).
